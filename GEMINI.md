**Important Note on Edge Function Deployment:**

While `supabase functions deploy` is the correct command for deploying Edge Functions, it currently relies on Docker for the bundling process. If Docker is not running, the deployment will fail. This is a known behavior of the Supabase CLI.

Therefore, to deploy the Edge Functions, please ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine before executing `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`.
