## AI Content Generation

- **AI Edge Functions:**
  - `create-brief`: Dual AI system (Gemini + Claude) for content generation.
  - `schedule-post`: Automated scheduling of posts.
  - `publish-post`: Content publishing pipeline to social media platforms.
  - `regenerate-post`: Allows regeneration of single posts.
- **Real-time Dashboard:** Live content generation tracking with Supabase Realtime subscriptions, status updates, and campaign overview.
- **Content Management:** Review and editing interface for generated content, including post approval workflow and content scheduling.

## Advanced Features

- **Scheduling System:** `pg_cron` automated processing for scheduled posts, with functionality to schedule, reschedule, and cancel posts. Includes an admin monitoring dashboard and scheduling logs.
- **Security & Performance:** Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP), rate limiting middleware, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and performance optimizations. An admin dashboard is available for system monitoring.

## Dynamic Roadmap Management System

- **Dynamic Configuration System:** Central `roadmap-config.json` for single source of truth, with automated `README.md` updates and interactive HTML roadmap reading.
- **CLI Automation Tools:** Node.js scripts and NPM commands for task status management and professional progress tracking.
- **Enhanced Documentation Management:** Interactive HTML dashboard with Chart.js visualizations for dynamic progress charts.

## Enhancing the Content Review Experience

- **Inline Text Editing System:** Advanced click-to-edit interface with real-time text editing and optimistic UI updates.
- **Content Regeneration System:** New Edge Function and API endpoint for single post regeneration with loading states and animations.
- **AI Image Generation Integration:** DALL-E 3 integration in `create-brief` Edge Function for platform-specific image sizing and display in the dashboard.

## Dual AI Provider Integration

- **Dual AI Provider Architecture:** Comprehensive AI provider abstraction layer with smart provider selection (Vertex AI for strategy, OpenAI for copywriting) and automatic failover/retry logic.
- **Enhanced Edge Functions:** Updated `create-brief` and `regenerate-post` with dual AI integration and intelligent routing.

## Enterprise Git Strategy & Security

- **GitHub Security Compliance:** Successfully passed GitHub push protection, ensuring a clean repository with zero committed secrets. Includes enterprise-grade security documentation and professional Git workflow implementation.
- **Secure Deployment Procedures:** Comprehensive deployment guide without sensitive data, credential management via Supabase Vault, and environment variable security best practices.

## Phase 7: Social Media Platform Integration (In Progress)

- **Social Media OAuth Setup:**
  - Database migration for `social_connections` table to store encrypted tokens.
  - Database migration for `upsert_social_connection` function for secure token storage.
  - Database migration for `decrypt_token` function to retrieve tokens securely.
  - UI for managing social media connections (`SocialConnectionsManager`).
  - API routes for initiating OAuth flows for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
  - Edge Functions for handling OAuth callbacks from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, including secure token storage.
- **Publishing Pipeline:**
  - `publish-post` Edge Function with API calls implemented for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

**Note:** Deployment of new and updated Edge Functions is pending due to local Docker environment requirements for the `supabase functions deploy` command. Manual deployment is required until this is resolved.
