Created by: Sayem Abdullah Rihan (@code-craka)

Repository: <https://github.com/code-craka/amplifyai>

Start Date: June 26, 2025

Status: Enterprise-Ready Production Platform ‚úÖ

üéØ Objective

## üîß PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS & REQUIREMENTS

## Package Management

- **Use pnpm as package manager** - Never use npm or yarn
- Commands: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`

## Development Tools

- **Use Supabase CLI instead of Docker** - Never try to run Docker
- Commands: `supabase start`, `supabase db reset`, `supabase functions deploy`
- **Do not attempt Docker operations** - Project uses Supabase CLI exclusively

## Development Server Setup

- **Standard dev server creation process**:
  1. `git pull` - Always pull latest changes first
  2. `pnpm install` - Install/update dependencies
  3. `supabase start` - Start local Supabase instance
  4. `supabase db reset` - Reset database to latest migrations
  5. `supabase functions deploy` - Deploy Edge Functions locally
  6. `pnpm dev` - Start Next.js development server
  7. **Verify all services running**: Frontend (localhost:3000), Supabase (localhost:54321)

## Branch Management for Future Features

- **FUTURE Phase Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Create feature branches** for all new FUTURE roadmap items (Phase 11+)
  - **Branch naming convention**: `feature/phase-X-description` (e.g., `feature/phase-11-subscription-tiers`)
  - **Development workflow**:
    1. `git checkout main && git pull` - Start from latest main
    2. `git checkout -b feature/phase-X-feature-name` - Create feature branch
    3. Implement feature following PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
    4. Test thoroughly with dev server setup process
    5. `git commit -m "feat(phase-X): feature description"` - Conventional commits
    6. Create Pull Request to main branch
    7. **Merge only after**: Testing, documentation updates, CLAUDE.md updates
  - **Never implement FUTURE phases directly on main** - Always use feature branches
  - **Feature branch cleanup**: Delete after successful merge to main

## Documentation & Memory Updates

- **Always update CLAUDE.md** when making code changes
- **Always update README.md** to reflect new features/changes
- **Always update CHANGELOG.md** with version increments and detailed changes
- **Always update GEMINI.md** for Gemini synchronization
- **Maintain project memory** - Document all technical decisions and solutions

## Git Workflow Requirements

- **Always run `git pull`** before making any changes
- **Test and verify all changes** before committing
- **Commit to project git** after every update/fix
- **Use conventional commits**: `git commit -m "feat(scope): description"`
- **Ensure clean working directory** before starting new work

## Code Quality Standards

- **Run linting and type checking** before commits: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`
- **Zero ESLint warnings/errors** requirement
- **TypeScript compilation must succeed**
- **Test all functionality** after changes

## Project Context Reminders

- **Supabase Auth** (NOT Clerk - user explicitly postponed Clerk)
- **Dual AI Provider System** (OpenAI + Vertex AI)
- **Enterprise Security** with GitHub push protection
- **Next.js 15 + React 19** with App Router
